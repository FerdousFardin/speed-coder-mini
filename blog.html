              What is the difference between

            <p>
              The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is
              that when using localStorage, the saved data will persist after
              the users session has ended. So if you close the browser or tab
              and then come back to the site, the data can still be retrieved.
              On the other hand when using sessionStorage the data would be
              removed after the tab or window is closed, hence the word
              “session” in the name sessionStorage.

              What is the difference between

              and
              <span class="font-bold"> Block Scope</span>?
            </h2>
            <p>
              A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is
              declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in
              the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line
              of code in the program, including inside blocks. On the otherhand,
              Block scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a
              specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let &
              const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In
              order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to
              create an object for it. Variables declared with the var keyword,
              do not have block scope. To sum up,<br />
              In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the
              window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global
              object. Block scopes are what you get mostly when you use if
              statements, for statements, and the like.

            <p>
              The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be
              clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call
              Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks
              the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it
              pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear
              again, and repeats the same process. A queue is a data structure
              that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get
              pushed into the queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that
              have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed to the
              Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their result
              printed out.

              Describe ways to get
              <span class="font-bold"> Undefined </span> in
              <span class="font-bold"> JavaScript </span>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Arguably, there are eight ways to get undefined in JavaScript.
              These are,<br />
              1. A variable is declared but never assigned a value to it will be
              undefined when we try to access it,<br />
              2. When a function is created but never added a return statement
              will give us undefined when we call the function,<br />
              3. Even if a return statement is present but no line of code is
              written after return statement is going to return same as
              above,<br />
              4. When a function with parameters is called without passing the
              arguments will take those unpassed arguments as undefined,<br />
              5. In an Object, a property which doesn't exist in that Object
              will give back undefined,<br />
              6. In an Array, accessing an element outside of the index range
              will return undefined,<br />
              7. Deleting an element from array then try to access that element
              with index is going to return undefined,<br />
              8. Setting a variable as undefined directly.
